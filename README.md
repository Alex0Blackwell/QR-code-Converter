# QR-code-Converter
This is a website that converts text to a qr-code. It's mostly just code from an API, ahh I know I'm freaking out. Pretty much just put an alright front end on it because I need it on my linux machine. If anyone finds this, I hope it will be useful. I use it for getting links from my computer to my phone.
